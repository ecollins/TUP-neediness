* Introduction
** Costs & Benefits of Stuff

 Suppose a bunch of poor households scattered across several
 different communities. We `target' some of these households
 and give them `stuff', or do 'stuff' to them.  What are the
 costs and benefits of doing this?

  - Stuff :: Stuff includes some productive assets, some
             training, and some food.
  - Costs :: Pretty well measured (we know precisely what
             was spent to acquire assets and food, and have
             reasonable estimates of the marginal cost of
             training and delivering).

  - Benefits :: Not so easy to say! If households perfectly insured and
       there were perfect capital markets then benefits ought to be
       about equal to costs.  But we think there are constraints that will affect
       the value of benefits.

** Measuring Benefits
 Think of problem from point of view of the household, solving
 a dynamic, stochastic problem subject to a variety of
 constraints. If `stuff' relaxes some of these constraints,
 benefits will be related to the change in a shadow price.

*** We're going to measure this shadow price

 - Call this shadow price the neediness of the household
   (we'll define it later).

 -  We'll show how we can use nothing more than data on
    non-durable consumption expenditures to estimate
    neediness.

 - We'll show how by /controlling/ for neediness we can better
   understand the operation of the program.

* Program
** Targeting the Ultra Poor in South Sudan
Modeled on program in Bangladesh.
  - Setting :: Southern South Sudan
  - Choice :: 249 women offered choice of different
              programs/assets (growing maize; rearing goats;
              rearing ducks; selling dried fish).
  - Training :: Four days of training (differs across programs).
  - Assets :: Transferred in late 2013; cost of assets about
              $249/woman.
  - Food :: Food which cost about $110/woman also
            delivered over a period of time.

** Targeting and Selection
Eligibility in South Sudan based on `absolute criteria'
(measured in a census; yielded 650 households):
 -  No salaried workers;
 -  Must not be involved in some other livelihood program;
 -  Must have access to cultivable land;
 -  Must have an adult female;
 -  Must satisfy at least three of following criteria:
   -  Spouse a day-laborer;
   -  Two or more children;
   -  One or more children working;
   -  House has fewer than three rooms;
   -  Adult female in household hasn't completed secondary school.

** Randomization & Attrition

 - Randomization ::
   -  250 eligible households randomly assigned to TUP
      `treatment';
   -  375 eligible households into `control'.

 - Attrition ::
   Not bad for a country with a civil war between baseline and
   followup. We have complete data for:

   -  223/250 TUP;
   -  331/375 Control

** Enterprise Selection & Training

*** Enterprise Selection
Preferences over different enterprise types elicited from TUP
households. Number of participants in each enterprise type
determined in advance, so not all households get first choice.

*** Training
TUP households received `business skills' training;
 -  Some general (financial literacy);
 -  Mostly enterprise specific (e.g., how to care for goats).
 -  Total of four days of training.
 -  Ongoing weekly group meetings (812 women), with food
 -  Some on-going monitoring and mentoring by program staff

** Data collection

 -  Census of adult women near Yei. Used to determine
    eligibility, serve as sample frame.

 -  Baseline survey in Summer 2013
 -  Follow-up survey in Summer 2014

** Facts from Census
 -  1279 households surveyed;
 -  80% of adult (>14) women between age of 2040.
 -  58% deemed `eligible'.

*** Eligible households
 -  17% less likely to have any paid work;
 -  Have fewer durable assets;
 -  Have less livestock;
 -  Eat more sorghum (regarded as inferior).

** A Modest Model of the Households
Take model of Bandiera et al. (2013); make it dynamic &
stochastic (also household level, to match our data).

*** Basic objects

 - Households indexed by $j\in\mathcal{J}.
 - Each period a state $s\in\mathcal{S}=\{1,\dots,S\}$ is realized
   (Markovian; transition probabilities $\pi_{sr}$).
 - Time discrete, indexed by $t$.

*** Preferences
 - Each date-state: utility  $U(C,R,\theta)$, (consumption vector,
   leisure, characteristics).
 - von Neumann-Morgenstern; exponential discounting with $\beta$.

** Occupation & Household characteristics

Occupation & Employment
R , employment (by
others) L, and self-employment S .
j
Earnings from employment Ws (L).

I Time allocated between leisure

Characteristics (& human capital)

** Assets & Production

** Budget constraint
All the households' decisions tied together by the budget
constraint:

is

Psj (C ) for household j

I Budget constraint holds at every date-state, with
multiplier

λjs :

Psj (C ) + qs (K 0 − K ) ≤ Fsj (K , S , θ) + Wsj (L).

** Modeling our experiment
From households' point of view, our experiment is just another
random thing that happens, so we can put the experiment
into the model. This allows us to think about how households
respond to the experimental treatment.
Experiment Let

S = C ∪ E.

Experiment if

s ∈ E.

T0 (s ) are controls in state s , while
households in T1 (s ) are `treated' if s ∈ E .

Assignment Households in

Random Assignment random if any given household has an
equal probability of being assigned to

Tg .

** Treatment & Control
Treatment A household assigned to treatment in state

ŝ

has

additional assets, training, and food. There's
another counterfactual state

s̃

where the

household would not receive these, but where
otherwise things would be the same:

Qŝj (K 0 ) ≥ Qs̃j (K 0 ); Hŝj (θ) ≥ Hs̃j (θ);
for all

and

Pŝj (C ) ≥ Ps̃j (C − Ĉ )
(6)

j ∈ T1 (ŝ ) and all K 0 , θ, and C .

Control A household in the control doesn't have these

Qŝj (K 0 ) =
for all

things different across

Qs̃j (K 0 );

Hŝj (θ) =

ŝ

and

Hs̃j (θ);

j ∈ T0 (ŝ ) and all K , θ, and C .
0

s̃ :

and

Pŝj (C ) = Ps̃j (C ),
(7)

** Expected Average Treatment Effects
Any change in the household's situation will be reected in

λjŝ /λjs̃

Use experiment to measure

** Easiest first order equation to exploit

If leisure and consumption additively separable and households
in the same place face the same prices (marginal costs) for
consumption goods, we just have Frisch demand system

λjs = ui (Csj , θsj )/psi .
This relies on data we may observe

(C , p , θ),

and on an

unknown function we have a lot of prior information about
(marginal utilities of consumption

u ).

** Estimating the ATE when marginal utilities are
known functions
Return to the equation defining the expected average
treatment effect. Using the fact that we now have

λjt = ui (Ctj )/pti ,
log

we substitute into this, obtaining

ui (Ctj , θtj ) = log pti +

Then

Γ log C + ζθ = log p + log λ.

Use expenditure data
Let

Xi = pi Ci e −i , where i

is some measurement error. Then

we have the system of equations
log

= (I − Γ−1 ) log p − Γ−1 ζθ + Γ−1 log λ + .

** ANCOVA Specification
Consider a standard `reduced form' approach to estimate the

and in treatment group g .

Interpret as product of a demand elasticity

estimated covariance matrix.

** Assumptions underlying structural interpretation
Really just six important assumptions, five involving
preferences:

I von Neumann-Morgenstern;
I Intertemporally separable;
I Within-period utility separable in consumption and leisure;
I Frischian elasticities constant;
I Characteristics don't affect shape of Engel curves;
I People in same places face same prices for consumption
goods.

These assumptions are pretty modest
Much less restrictive than what is usually assumed in
parametric Engel curve estimation.

In three parts:
  1. ATE on expenditures; interpret as elasticities & neediness.
  2. ATE on assets (use neediness as a control)

  3. ATE on occupation & employment (use neediness as a control)

** Employment and Occupation
Prediction from the model: a small decrease in neediness will
(weakly) increase leisure, unless the household is initially only
self-employed, in which case the change in leisure is
ambiguous; further,

* Conclusion
** Summary of Results
  1. Treatment results in a significant reduction in neediness;
     true both for average (reduction of 0.21 std. deviations),
     and in sense of first-order stochastic dominance.

  2. Both numbers of and values of assets increase for average
     treated household. Some of these increases related to
     production; others to reduced neediness.

  3. Significant shifts in women's self-employment; increases
     in livestock management and small business. Also shifts
     for the household away from casual agricultural labor into
     more skilled occupations and into leisure.

** Final Remarks
Considered a standard RCT of a standard intervention (TUP).

 -  A little bit of structure and applied demand theory goes a
long way to helping us interpret the average treatment
effect on log expenditures; we can recover important
elasticities and measures of neediness.

 -  Obvious next step: Invert Engel curves to change $\lambda$ to
    monetary benefit.  In practice we don't have /all/ consumption
   expenditures, so additional assumptions required.

 -  With estimates of demand elasticities and neediness
    possible to tackle interesting counterfactual policy
    questions.

** COMMENT The Variable Elasticity of Substitution Demand System
Let a household's preferences over $n$
different consumption goods depend on a momentary utility function
#+name: eq:utility
#+begin_equation
 #+LATEX: U(c_1,\dots,c_n)=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\frac{(c_i+\phi_i)^{1-\gamma_i}-1}{1-\gamma_i}.
#+end_equation
- The parameters $\{\gamma_i\}$ govern the curvature of the $n$ sub-utility functions;
- The parameters $\{\alpha_i\}$  govern the weight of the $n$ sub-utilities in total momentary
  utility; and
- The parameters $\{\phi_i\}$ `translate' the commodity
  space in such a way to make it simple to accomodate subsistence
  levels for some goods, or more generally to control the marginal
  utility of consumption near zero for any of the goods.
*** Novelty comes from the fact that the $\gamma_i$ are allowed to differ
*** Frisch Demands in the VES System
A Frisch demand system is one that models how demand varies as a
function of prices and of the /marginal (indirect) utility of income/ $\lambda$.
**** Frisch demands for the VES System
Straight from the first-order conditions to the consumer's problem, we obtain
\[ 
   c_i(p,\lambda)=\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{p_i}\right)^{1/\gamma_i}\lambda^{-1/\gamma_i}-\phi_i.
\]
Notice how /prices/ and /neediness/ determine how much of good $i$ the
consumer purchases.
***** Same $\lambda$ appears in all demand functions
This means we can /pick and choose/ which consumption goods to use to
estimate $\lambda$.
*** Aside: Marshallian (Uncompensated) Demands

Marshallian demands, of course, are the usual sort in which demand
varies as a function of prices and income (or aggregate expenditures).
**** In the VES demand system 
Marshallian demands /exist/, but they're typically difficult to /represent/.
*** Relationship between $\lambda$ and $x$
Pinned down by plugging the Frisch demands into the budget constraint
#
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^np_i\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{p_i}\right)^{1/\gamma_i}\lambda^{-1/\gamma_i}  +
\sum_{i=1}^np_i\phi_i =  x.
\]
#
Thus, by the implicit function theorem $\lambda(p,x)$ is the solution
to an equation of the form
#
\[
   \sum_{i=0}^na_i(p)\lambda^{b_i} = 0.
\]
#
This resembles an ordinary polynomial, except that the exponents $b_i$
are all negative, and may take any real value.
**** Rank of Marshallian demand system is equal to the number of distinct $b_i$
**** COMMENT Compare that with the case for Cobb-Douglas utility
For, say, Cobb-Douglas demand systems the relation between income
(aggregate expenditures) and
the marginal utility of income $\lambda$ is simple: $\lambda=1/
x$. (Thus a Rank 1 demand system)
